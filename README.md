# GlobalC Tool

## What is this?
It's a small tool for Need For Speed World GlobalC.lzc management. It was written back in 2015 and wasn't changed since then, so expect smelly code and, probably, some bugs.

This tool is able to open GlobalC.lzc file and unpack/compress JDLZ-archives inside. For example, you can use `tools/unpack all` menu item and then save file to get a GlobalC with all JDLZ archives unpacked. Game should work correctly with unpacked files.
